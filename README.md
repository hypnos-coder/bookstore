#This is our bookstore project

In order to run the project by your side you have some modification to do. ypu need 
to change the database credential to yours, you can find it in the authentification.java file.
we add some modification. The logout, profile, about, contact us icon are clickable(even if it is not so good). 
we implemented a method that keep the user logged in, that means once you signed in one time, the next time you run the program you will be redirected to the landing page right by the way. if you want to land on the login or registration form again, you will have to logout properly.
